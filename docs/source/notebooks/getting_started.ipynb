    "LLMs are powerful but can be hard to steer and prone to errors when deployed. At the same time, new models and techniques are being developed all the time. We want to make it easy for you to experiment with different techniques, understand their tradeoffs, and make informed decisions for your specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The package is organized to make it easy to test architectures around higher level \"functionality\". This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Retrieval-augmented generation\n",
    "- Agent tool use\n",
    "- Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "They all share a same \"Task\" interface to provide some abstractions to create and evaluate different models in-context, including different \"environments\" and shared evaluators.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to get started with the package. For any given task, the main steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install the package\n",
    "2. Select a task\n",
    "3. Download the dataset\n",
    "4. Define your architecture\n",
    "5. Run the evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluations use [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com) (see: [docs](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/)) to host the benchmark datasets and track your architecture's traces and evaluation metrics. \n",
