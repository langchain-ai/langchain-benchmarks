retrieval_prompt = """{retriever_description} Before beginning to research the user's question, first think for a moment inside <scratchpad> tags about what information is necessary for a well-informed answer. If the user's question is complex, you may need to decompose the query into multiple subqueries and execute them individually. Sometimes the search engine will return empty search results, or the search results may not contain the information you need. In such cases, feel free to try again with a different query. 

After each call to the Search Engine Tool, reflect briefly inside <search_quality></search_quality> tags about whether you now have enough information to answer, or whether more information is needed. If you have all the relevant information, write it in <information></information> tags, WITHOUT actually answering the question. Otherwise, issue a new search.

Here is the user's question: <question>{query}</question> Remind yourself to make short queries in your scratchpad as you plan out your strategy."""  # noqa: E501
